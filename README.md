How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

By applying best practices while writing my code and creating tests that check to see if the code runs properly. 
With the test cases, I want to test and see if the code will run properly if the user inputs invalid entries and the code
will alret the user that the entry was invalid. If the tests come back with failures or error during the testing, I make
sure the the areas of issue are corrected so the code runs more smoothly and securely.

How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

By following how the user wants the code to operate. Creating bullet points of what the requirements are so that there is little
to no bias in my coding. This allows for the best practices to be put in place for the code to be created.

How do I approach designing software?

Reviewing the requirements outlined by the client for the project, testing the code that was created making sure that there
are no errors or bugs. To do so, while writing the code I will add comments in areas of the code showing what variables
are to be, what functions do for each class, and make sure the tests are checking to see if users are going over the 
required number of characters needed for each variable or not, if the code is creating a unique ID for this project, and if
the Service File is running its functions properly without errors or failures.
